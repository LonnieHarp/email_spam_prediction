Spam Prediction
    - in this program I am using machine learning to decipher weather or not 
    the email is Spam
    - The data used to make this program is from kaggle. 
    - Spam is fake. while ham is real

Workflow To Follow
    - mail data
    - data pre processing
    - split the data into training data
    - will be using a logistic regression model

    - give new mail the trained data will decide whether or not it is fake.

Imports
    - Pandas (pd) used to analyze big data sets and make conclusions
    - train_test_split is used to split the data in half and train it
    - TfidfVectorizer used so that the text can be read by the computer
        -changes the text into meaningful numbers that fit machine learning
        algorithm for predictions. 
    - Logistic regression is the method in which I am using to train the data
    this is capable of predicting the probability of whether or not the email will
    be spam or not. 
    - accuracy_score is to determine how accurate the data is.

Data Collection
    - Collecting data from the .cvs file mail_data
    - Replacing all unused values with a null string. 

Label Encoding
    - Making the data more easily read by changing spam to 0 and ham to 1
    - Separating data, massage and category. 

Splitting the data
    - split the data into two parts. one part will be the training data
    while the other half will be the testing data. 
    - All of the training data in the the x_train will end up in the y_train
    and all of the test data in x_test will end up in y_test
    - splitting the data uses the function train_test_split() that was imported.
    - test_size determines how much of the data will be used. In my case i use 20% 
    of the data as test data and the other 80% as training data.
    - random_state is so the computer does not memorize the data as it comes in.

Feature Extraction
    - Going through the words in the document while keeping track of how many times a word is being used.
    And will give the word a score depending on how many times the word is used. 
    - Selecting what words we are going to look at to determine whether or not the email is spam
        - min_df is the minimum score of the word, if less than 1 ignores it. if more than one include it
        - stop_words are the words that are repeated multiple times. These words are ignored.
        - lowercase changes all letters into lowercase for easier processing.
    - x_train_features is fitting all the data into x_train using the feature extraction that was just made.

Train The Model 
    - model is using the imported logistic regression
    - y_train contains all of the labels

checking Accuracy
    - predictions_training is pushing in the 80 percent that is being used to train the model
    - then checking the accuracy of the prediction model with the y_train.
    - repeated with the testing data.

Predicting Spam
    - First i am choosing one of the emails from the mail_data file at random and making sure that it has the contents of the email in hand
    - pass in the massage that was choosin and extract the features of the email
    - Then finally using the logistic regression algorithm predicting if it is spam or not.
